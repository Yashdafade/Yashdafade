## üöÄ About Me
I‚Äôm Yash Dafade ‚Äî a passionate Full Stack Web Developer and AI enthusiast, currently working on a real-world School Management Software suite that‚Äôs live in production.

I specialize in the **MERN stack**, but my journey has taken an exciting turn toward **Python-based AI/ML solutions**, especially in facial recognition and smart automation. I‚Äôve built and deployed an **InsightFace-based attendance system** that uses deep learning to identify students via facial embeddings ‚Äî seamlessly integrated into our Node.js backend via a Python FastAPI microservice.

My role goes beyond just coding ‚Äî I‚Äôve been leading module-wise development, managing GitHub workflows (`dev` ‚Üí `main`), setting up **CI/CD pipelines with Render & GitHub Actions**, and planning migration strategies to VPS hosting for performance optimization.

I'm not just a techie ‚Äî I'm a builder with vision, always looking ahead. If you're searching for someone who bridges the gap between web development and AI-driven innovation, then I‚Äôm your guy.
