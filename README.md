## üöÄ About Me
Currently, I am working on a comprehensive School Management Software project, where I have successfully developed and deployed a pre-admission console module that is live and operational at my first client school. This project showcases my ability to implement cookie-based authentication, manage CRUD operations, and develop robust, scalable solutions. I am now expanding the system to include an inventory management module for tracking books, uniforms, printing receipts, and storing various types of payment information.

I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set and contribute to innovative projects. If you are looking for a dedicated and skilled Full Stack Web Developer to join your team, let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to create impactful solutions.
